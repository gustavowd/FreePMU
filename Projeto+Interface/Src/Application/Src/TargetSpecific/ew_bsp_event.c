* DESCRIPTION:
*   This file is part of the interface (glue layer) between an Embedded Wizard
*   generated UI application and the board support package (BSP) of a dedicated
*   target.
*   This template provides a system event mechanism, that can be used in
*   combination with an operating system to sleep and to continue (resume) the
*   operation of the UI main loop.

* FUNCTION:
*   EwBspWaitForSystemEvent
*
* DESCRIPTION:
*   The function EwBspWaitForSystemEvent should be called from the Embedded
*   Wizard main loop in case there are no pending events, signals or timers that
*   have to be processed by the UI application.
*   The function EwBspWaitForSystemEvent is used to sleep the given time span or
*   to suspend the UI task. The function returns as soon as a new system event
*   occurs or when the given timeout value is expired.
*   Typically, a system event is a touch event or a key event or any event
*   from your device driver.
*
* ARGUMENTS:
*   aTimeout - timeout value in milliseconds.
*
* RETURN VALUE:
*   None
*

         10 ms in order to ensure that the UI application is continuously working,
         e.g. to get new touch values or to receive data from a device driver.
         This makes the usage of this template very simple.
         If you want to implement a completly event driven system, you can use
         the given timeout without limiting it. In this case you have to ensure
         that the touch driver or your device drivers are resuming the UI task
         by calling TriggerSystemEvent().
